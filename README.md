Pokemon GO is a location-aware game for mobile devices by Niantic and The Pokemon Company. The game provides very little information about the most efficient way to play. One area of interest has to do with the factors that affect the combat power (CP) and hit points (HP) of a specific Pokemon after evolution, because the weak can be traded away to support the strong.

I performed an analysis in R that shows which factors and interactions are important using linear regressions that accounted for 98% of post-evolution CP and 96% of post-evolution HP.
